# <center> Consumer Finance Company</center>
> You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

>If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
> The data given 'loan.csv' contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
>In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

## General Information
-The project is all about the finance company which we analyse the data in that sense so that company or organisation will help to reduce the risk factor.


## Conclusions
 
-Grade is determined by the borrowers credit scores and credit history. So it can be used to understand the 
character of a consumer. Found that the Grade between C and G has more defaults. 
 
-Debt-to-Income(dti) and Revolving Utilization(revol_util) can used to measure the capacity of a consumer 
like how much credit is being used compared with how much credit is available.  
 
-Open_acc and Home_Ownership  Found that the Open_acc < 5 and Home_Ownership as RENT has 
more defaults.
