## General Information


#### Business Problem Statement:

> We are working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
> The data given to us contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Conclusions
 


> Slightly Higher the loan amount for a higher the annual income .
> Yearly, there is an increase in number of charged off.
> With increase in loan amount there is an increase in intrest rate
> Higher is the charged off ratio for higher intrest rate.
> Higher the annual income higher the loan amount slightly
> Intrest rate is increasing with loan amount & in increases is there in high charged off
>  With increase in loan amount there is an increase in intrest rate
>  Intrest rate is increasing with loan amount & in increases is there in high charged off.
> Higher the annual income higher the loan amount, provided interest rate is more.
> Higher intrest rate results in high Charged Off ratio yet numbers of defaulters.
