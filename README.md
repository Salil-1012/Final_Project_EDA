## General Information


#### Business Problem Statement:

> We are working for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
> The data given to us contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Conclusions
 


> Slightly Higher the loan amount for a higher the annual income .
> Yearly, there is an increase in number of charged off.
> With increase in loan amount there is an increase in intrest rate
> Higher is the charged off ratio for higher intrest rate.
> Higher the annual income higher the loan amount slightly
> Intrest rate is increasing with loan amount & in increases is there in high charged off
> 1. With increase in loan amount there is an increase in intrest rate
2. Intrest rate is increasing with loan amount & in increases is there in high charged off.
3. Higher the annual income higher the loan amount, provided interest rate is more.
4. Higher intrest rate results in high Charged Off ratio yet numbers of defaulters.
